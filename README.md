# Coding Jobs

### About Our Project

We were inspired to build this site by spending time on the world's leading websites for jobs, which are incredible sites but they can be overwhelming, full of distractions, inundated with advertisements, and containing irrelevant, sponsored job results.

Coding Jobs was built to provide software engineers with a simple, low noise site strictly for finding software development jobs.
